In the next 100 days, I plan to fully understand the basics of python and complete projects and also Machine Learning projects.
I plan to spend at most 4 to 5 hours of coding. If I have the whole day to myself, I will use half of it to better myself and complete miniprojects.
I like coding mostly in the evenings so that will do. But I will also use afternoons or my free times. 

Fun Fact: Games, Math and Computer are the Loves of my Life.
